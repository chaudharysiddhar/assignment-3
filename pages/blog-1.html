            <p class="blog-thoughts">Blockchain technology is like a digital ledger that records transactions across computers in a network. Each transaction is stored in a block, and these blocks are linked together in a chain, making it difficult to alter past records. This decentralized system increases transparency, security, and trust since everyone in the network can see the transactions, reducing the need for intermediaries like banks. Bitcoin and Ethereum are examples of cryptocurrencies that use blockchain technology.</p>
