            <p class="blog-thoughts">Robotics is about making machines that can do tasks on their own. These machines can move, think, and even learn from their experiences. They're used in factories to build things, in homes for chores like cleaning, and in space exploration to do jobs humans can't. They use sensors to understand things and do tasks like cleaning, building stuff, or helping doctors. Robots are like super helpers that can do cool things like exploring space or playing games with you at home.
